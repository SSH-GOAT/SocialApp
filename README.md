# Social Networking App

Welcome to the Social Networking App! This application allows users to connect with each other through a follow request feature. It includes various functionalities designed to enhance user experience and maintain a healthy interaction environment.

## Features

### 1. Follow Request System
- Users can send follow requests to other users.
- Each user is allowed to send follow requests to up to **3 users per minute** to prevent spam and ensure meaningful connections.

### 2. Friends Management
- Users can manage their friend lists seamlessly, accepting or rejecting follow requests from others.

### 3. Blocking Users
- If a user blocks another user, the blocked user will not be able to send follow requests to the blocker.
- This feature helps users maintain control over their interactions.

### 4. Follow Request Handling
- If a user rejects a follow request, the sender must wait **24 hours** before sending another request to the same user.
- This cooldown period promotes thoughtful engagement and reduces the chances of unwanted interactions.

### 5. Rate Limiting
- The app implements rate limiting to enhance performance and prevent abuse, allowing users to send a maximum of 3 follow requests per minute.
